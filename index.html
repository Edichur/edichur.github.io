                            <p> My four years staying at Benilde as a college student was a blast. When I entered Benilde I was afraid of not fitting in with anyone, that is why joining <b>Association of Information
                                Management (AIM)</b> is a big gamble for me. However, this gamble turns out to be one of my best decisions in life because
                                AIM taught me new set of skills and introduced me to many people that has been part of my whole college life, people that are willing to help you out 
                                and you know got your back. The experience I gained joining AIM is what pushed me to also join <b>Ad Astra</b>, which not only
                                gave me the same experience as it was in AIM, but it also gave me technical experience in Web Development that I am using 
                                during the development of our thesis and during my internship. Even though we started slow
                                because of having online classes during the pandemic,  everything gradually gets better when the transition to
                                hybrid modality starts. I experienced hardships in my academics and organizational involvement alike, but also fun times
                                with my friends, organizations, and professors; These moments made me who I am today,
                                a graduating Benildean that achieved and will continue to achieve more in the near future.

                                With all the knowledge and experienced I gained on my stay at Benilde, I will continue to pursue my dream of becoming a 
                                software developer. I will learn more knowledge about the IT world and in a more broad scope so that I can be able to 
                                gain skills on multiple fields within the IT industry. I will use the Benildean influence to help create more opportunities 
                                for myself and the people I wanted to help. And lastly, I wanted to pay it forward, because it is one of the things I 
                                learned as a Benildean Scholar, to pay it forward and help the community around you with all the skillsets and 
                                knowledge you gained while being a Benildean student.

                            <p>
                                After my internship, I see myself finding an entry-level job under web development or software testing because of the 
                                experience I have in these fields. I will start my entry-level job even before I graduate so that when the time comes 
                                that I actually graduated, I already have the edge over other fresh grads trying to find a job of their own. I will try 
                                to learn more about the world of IT and continously practice the Benildean Core Values I learned during my stay in Benilde.
                                It is now my time for pay it forward for all the help I received as a Benildean Scholar and I will continue to do things 
                                extraordinarily well. <b><i>Animo La Salle, Animo Benilde!</i></b>

                            <p>After 3 months or almost 500 hours of staying at <b>Information Managers Inc. (InfoMan)</b> I learned so much about
                                Quality Assurance and Software Testing. When testing our system <b>Electronic Building Occupancy Permit System (EBOPS)</b> 
                                We learned how to create and conduct test scripts, find for bugs and revisions in the system, and document it as a Service Request Form (SRF) for the programmers to fix. 
                                We also learned how documenting these bugs are important because these documentations make it easier to track which bugs has already been fixed, 
                                needs to be retested, and those that are yet to be fixed. Communication between the QA team and the Programming team is also 
                                important to avoid miscommunication; I remember experiencing it firsthand because we somehow used the wrong documentation format that not 
                                only delayed the testing process but also caused confusion to the side of the programming team. In the end, I am very grateful to all 
                                the supervisors and colleagues we get to know during our stay in InfoMan, I will continue to practice all the lessons I learned during 
                                my stay on to my future profession that I will get into.

                            <p>After working for 3 months at InfoMan, I experienced their chill working environment firsthand. Unlike the work 
                                environment that I am aware in my school organizations, the environment at the company is chill and silent. It is 
                                usually quiet during working hours and all are focused on doing their specific tasks. Despite this, it is easy to 
                                approach our mentors and supervisors when we have a question about our tasks. Mentors are also knowledgeable on their 
                                practice, which makes it easy for us to understand the lessons that they are trying to deliver. Aside from technical 
                                lessons, they also gave us advise and stories about their experience and what should we expect once we enter the 
                                working industry. Unfortunately, we finished our QA testing tasks 2 months in the company we lack additional tasks so 
                                we are given the tasks to create reports and assisting other departments.
